# Étale coordinates for a finite ordered support

An ordered lift of a degree-`d` divisor gives `d` actual curve points by
projection.  Choose an affine one-variable étale coordinate chart at every
one of those points.  Repeated support points are intentionally retained:
their multiplicities are needed by the residual stabilizer and monic-root
calculations.

The named downstream consumer is the pointwise local comparison in
`PointedIncidenceDescent`.
