# Challenge: the divisor-line-bundle dictionary on a smooth proper curve

This contract captures the remaining A3 existence and equivalence deliverable: a scheme-level
dictionary relating chosen invertible-sheaf representatives, the Picard group, and Weil divisor
classes. The affine tilde restriction isomorphism and global tilde invertibility are now proved
in checked code. A checked equivalence reduces existence of the dictionary to the full Picard
comparison together with a divisor-class/Picard equivalence; chosen line bundles and their
compatibilities are constructed from those data. The contract does not prescribe a canonical
affine-chart normalization. On affine schemes, the localized tensor maps have now been assembled
into an objectwise tilde tensor-product isomorphism. This gives a canonical injective
module-Picard to scheme-Picard map. For affine Dedekind domains, the divisor map has exactly the
principal divisors as kernel, divisor classes are equivalent to its range, and the chosen tilde
line bundles are tensor-additive. Canonical Picard surjectivity is now proved equivalent to the
reverse tensor-unit/local-rank-one comparison, while the forward affine gap is isolated as the
checked localization predicate `AffineTilde.TildeReflectsInvertibility`. What remains here
includes discharging those comparison inputs, proving the checked
`AffineChart.DedekindOrderCompatibility` on curve charts, global curve divisor gluing, and
global divisor-class/Picard surjectivity. The chart API already identifies height-one primes
with ambient codimension-one points and consumes the compatibility to reindex whole principal
divisors. Its local divisor-to-Picard map has exactly those principal divisors as kernel,
descends injectively to chart divisor classes, and identifies them with its scheme-Picard range.
`AffineTilde.TildeReflectsInvertibility` and `AffineChart.DedekindOrderCompatibility` are checked
conditional interfaces, not solved existence results or separately registered Challenge
declarations; discharging them remains part of this unchanged global A3 Challenge. The
residue-degree product formula remains independently isolated by the registered A2 Challenge.
Transport from the Picard group of a chart's coordinate spectrum to the open subscheme itself,
and then overlap-compatible gluing to `X`, also remain open. The contract earns no Mazur
completion credit.
